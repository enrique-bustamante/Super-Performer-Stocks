    <p class="w3-text-grey">To get the rankings for the prior gameweek,
    click the 'Make Copies of Tables' button. The model will then pull the ranking
    from here and use it in the updated tables for the current week. The screen
    will change to a screen with a button to return to the home page. Next, click
    on the 'Update Tables' button to run the algorithm and update the tables. Once
    you're done this, you can click one of the links up top to see the position
    chart that you desire. It is recommended to wait until all bonus points have
    been added by Premier League before running the model.</p> </div>

                the numerical data through a Standard Scaler, then a Random Forest Regressor.
                The final ranking is a combination of the value, the predicted points, and the
